Introduction:
Covid-19 is a pandemic that people around the world are struggling to survive both economically and physically. However, the way each person gives the fight to survive is different. That is the reason the probability of survival is not the same for each person. The probability of survivor depends on two different factors. First is a health condition, and the second is healthcare accessibility. The health condition at some points depends on food security, and healthcare accessibility depends on the socioeconomic of a specific group of people.

COVID Death and Case Data: We will analyze the Covid-19's effect on Massachusettsâ€™s cities by considering food accessibility and economic factors in the neighborhood. We have death and case-based data for each day since the starting point of epidemics. Based on longitude and latitude in the dataset, we will assign numbers to each city in Massachusetts.

MA city based socioeconomical data: We also have Census data regarding each city's population, income, age-range, and race. We will look for a correlation between a neighborhood's features with the number of COVID cases and death rates. So, we will have a better understanding of factors that affects mortality rate and case numbers.

Food Security and detailed information: To consider food security, we will use the Census' 2019 food security dataset, detailed datasets regarding food security, and each city's socioeconomic condition. In this dataset, we have detailed information regarding household members, race, education, and the number of times they provide food. These types of information will help us to conclude the impact of income and education level on food security and, in the end, COVID numbers in a specific city.

Project Goal: The goal is to draw a clear picture of communities more prone to COVID-19 by data visualization. Thanks to a better understanding of the situation, we can control pandemic in later steps. For vaccination, there is a need to start with people who need it more. In this project, we will classify the patient according to their risk level and conclude groups that should provide vaccination first.
